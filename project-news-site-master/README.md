# News Site

The news site I created is very simple to navigate and everything works according to the mockup received. 

## The problem

I approached the problem with a splitting the big problem into little problem and to-do list so I could affront one small task at the time.
The videos given to use in the pre-course session were very helpful and what I couldn't do with that I typed it on Google  

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
